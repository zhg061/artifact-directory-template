Title:
Differential Gene Expression Analysis of Human Opioid Abusers

Abstract:
Opioid abuse is a serious national crisis. The opioid epidemic is unique and important because 21-29% of patients who are prescribed opioids end up misusing them. Opioids increase the amount of dopamine made in the brain by increasing dopamine-synthesizing neurons- making them very easy to become addicted to. This study explores the long-lasting changes in gene expression that may contribute to addiction, cravings, and relapse by studying subjects who continuously used opioids. Using DESeq2 and WGCNA, our analyses identified differentially expressed genes by finding which genes were up-regulated and down-regualted. We also found distinct gene networks associated with opioid abuse. Overall, 28 genes were found to be down-regualted and 16 genes were up-regulated. The opioid-regulated genes identified from our project could possibly serve as new therapeutic targets to help combat opioid addiction.
